Ribbon Packaging System
======================

This project aims to simplify the process of building omnibus packages that include
any combination of:

  - packages from an upstream apt or yum repo
  - source builds from git or SVN repositories
  - pip or gem packages

and produce rpms or debs that can be installed to /opt with no system dependencies where
possible.
